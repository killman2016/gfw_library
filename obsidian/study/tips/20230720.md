烂事届因果，无视享清净。
弱者复仇，强者原谅，智者无视。
凡是磨你的，必能渡你。

Tax his land, Tax his bed, Tax the table At which he's fed. 
Tax his work, Tax his pay, He works for peanuts Anyway! 
Tax his cow, Tax his goat, Tax his pants, Tax his coat. 
Tax his tobacco, Tax his drink, Tax him if he Tries to think. 
Tax his car, Tax his gas, Find other ways To tax his ass Tax all he has 
Then let him know That you won't be done Till he has no dough. 
When he screams and hollers; Then tax him some more, 
Tax him till He's good and sore. Then tax his coffin, Tax his grave, 
Tax the sod in Which he's laid. When he's gone, 
Do not relax, It's time to apply The inheritance tax.
